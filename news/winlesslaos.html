      <h1>Leviathans Go 0–18: WORST Season in PJPL History</h1>
      <p>Today</p>
      <img src="../assets/images/news/winlesslaos.jpg"
           alt="Laos Leviathans go winless"
           style="display:block; width:100%; max-width:800px; height:200px; object-fit:cover; border-radius:8px; margin:1.5rem auto;">

      <p>The Laos Leviathans have made history — for all the wrong reasons. With an 0–18 record, 16 total points scored, and a staggering -200 point differential, the Leviathans have completed the worst season ever recorded in the PJPL.</p>

      <p>Their performance in the Spring 2025 campaign not only earned them a place in the league’s record books — it redefined the bottom of the competitive barrel. The previous low was held by the Louisiana Walruses (now Baton Rouge Jumbo Shrimp), who posted a 3–17 season in 2024. The Leviathans shattered that floor with an 0% win rate and failed to show even marginal signs of progress throughout the season.</p>

      <p>At the center of the collapse is Declan Fenniak, the Leviathans' lone player and the subject of league-wide scrutiny since the team’s inception. Widely regarded as unqualified for the PJPL level, Fenniak’s inclusion in the league has drawn consistent criticism — particularly given that the Leviathans franchise is owned by his father.</p>

      <h2>A Season of Futility</h2>

      <p>The stats are difficult to process. In 18 matches, the Leviathans scored just 16 total points, while allowing 216. That’s an average game score of 0.9–12.0, with no shutout wins and zero games even reaching double-digit points. Their closest result was a 4–12 loss — the only time they managed to score more than three points.</p>

      <p>“It wasn’t just losing — it was getting completely outclassed,” one league analyst said. “This wasn’t a team that struggled to close out games. This was a team that wasn’t competitive from the opening serve.”</p>

      <p>The Leviathans were a Spring 2025 expansion team, joining the PJPL alongside the Cambodia Chameleons, Suriname Storm, and Zimbabwe Zebras. While their fellow newcomers found varying degrees of success — the Storm and Chameleons both made the playoffs — Laos never looked remotely prepared for the level of competition.</p>

      <h2>Accountability and Controversy</h2>

      <p>Declan Fenniak’s presence in the league has raised uncomfortable questions about merit and fairness in team composition. While most PJPL players have earned their spot through proven skill or competitive reputation, Fenniak entered the league under the shadow of nepotism — a stigma that only intensified with each loss.</p>

      <p>The backlash has not been subtle. Fans, analysts, and even opposing players have criticized both Fenniak’s performance and the league’s decision to allow an ownership-player connection without performance oversight. Some have called for a reevaluation of player eligibility standards, particularly as the PJPL continues to grow in legitimacy and public attention.</p>

      <p>Commissioner Jeremy Fragrance has yet to release a public statement on the Leviathans’ season, though sources within the league office confirm that internal discussions are already underway regarding competitive integrity and future expansion vetting.</p>

      <h2>A Problem With No Easy Fix</h2>

      <p>Looking ahead to Summer 2025, the Leviathans are confirmed to return — a decision that’s already generating backlash. While other teams prepare to upgrade rosters and compete for the Golden Paddle, Laos remains a glaring question mark.</p>

      <p>No player changes have been announced. No coaching or strategic shifts have been hinted at. And unless something drastic happens, there’s little reason to believe their Summer campaign will look any different.</p>

      <p>“Something has to change,” said Monkey's player Austin Allen. “There are real athletes in this league. Guys who train. Guys who care. The Leviathans are making a joke out of it.”</p>

      <p>The league's credibility — and the Leviathans' — may depend on what happens next.</p>

      <p>For now, the record stands: 0 wins. 18 losses. 16 points scored. 216 points allowed. A -200 differential.</p>

      <p><strong>It is, without question, the worst season in PJPL history.</strong></p>
