      <h1>Contract Clock Ticking: Is This the End for John Rusinko?</h1>
      <p>Today</p>
      <img src="../assets/images/news/rusinkofuture.jpg" alt="John Rusinko" class="article-banner" style="display:block; width:100%; max-width:800px; height:200px; object-fit:cover; border-radius:8px; margin:1.5rem auto;">

      <p>As the PJPL transitions into its Summer 2025 season, the Baton Rouge Jumbo Shrimp face a defining question: Should they re-sign John Rusinko, or is it time to move on? With his contract set to expire at the start of 2026, the team’s longtime player is entering what may be the final stretch of his PJPL career — and with no extension in sight, speculation is mounting.</p>

      <p>Rusinko’s story is closely tied to the league’s early years. He debuted in 2024 with the Louisiana Walruses, a franchise that later rebranded as the Baton Rouge Jumbo Shrimp. From the outset, his performance metrics painted a bleak picture: just three wins in twenty games during the inaugural season — the worst record in the league.</p>

      <p>The team’s rebrand did little to shift their fortunes. While Baton Rouge did improve in Spring 2025, finishing 5–12, they still missed the playoffs and ended second-last in the standings. Rusinko's own struggles remained evident, with the team holding the second-worst point differential in the league at -54. Despite flashes of resilience, consistency has eluded him.</p>

      <p>“John’s been with us since the beginning,” said a team staff member familiar with internal discussions. “There’s no questioning his commitment, but performance matters. At some point, loyalty has to be weighed against results.”</p>

      <h2>No Longer the League’s Worst — But Still Not Enough</h2>

      <p>In some ways, Rusinko has been saved from harsher criticism due to the arrival of Declan Fenniak, whose 0–18 season with the Laos Leviathans in Spring 2025 has become the new low point in PJPL history. But while Fenniak’s catastrophic debut has pulled scrutiny away from Baton Rouge, it hasn’t rewritten the narrative surrounding Rusinko: a player who has never delivered a winning season and continues to underperform relative to the rising standard of competition.</p>

      <p>In a league featuring elite talents like Austin Allen, Carsten Scheuer, and emerging stars like Brock LeBaron and Wynton Chomay, the margin for mediocrity is shrinking. With ten teams expected in the Summer 2025 campaign and playoff spots likely capped at eight, there’s no room for stagnation.</p>

      <h2>What Comes Next for Baton Rouge?</h2>

      <p>Rusinko’s current deal carries him through the end of the calendar year. While that gives the Jumbo Shrimp time to evaluate, it also places pressure on the upcoming season to provide clarity. If the team starts poorly, calls for change will intensify.</p>

      <p>There are also long-term structural questions at play. Baton Rouge has not pursued free-agent talent, nor have they signaled interest in replacing Rusinko with a rookie. Whether due to loyalty, limited options, or a belief in development, the franchise has stood by its veteran — even as other teams have reshaped their rosters with greater ambition.</p>

      <p>From the outside, the lack of urgency is puzzling. PJPL Commissioner Jeremy Fragrance has made it clear that “every team should be striving to win now,” especially as league sponsors and spectator interest continue to grow. With high-profile backers like Jagmeet Singh, Pierre Poilievre, and Dope Pickleball, the PJPL is no longer an experimental circuit — it’s a legitimate proving ground. And in that environment, sentimentality comes at a cost.</p>

      <h2>A Career at a Crossroads</h2>

      <p>Rusinko has remained silent publicly about his contract or future, and the team has issued no statements regarding negotiations. But within Baton Rouge, the question looms: Is he still the future — or simply part of the past?</p>

      <p>If Summer 2025 becomes yet another season of bottom-table finishes and negative point differential, the decision may make itself. But if Rusinko can stabilize his performance, play competitively, and keep Baton Rouge within playoff contention, there may yet be a case for continuity.</p>

      <p>Either way, the countdown has begun.</p>
