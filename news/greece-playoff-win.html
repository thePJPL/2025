      <p>The Greece Chicken Frogs are moving on. In a decisive Game 3 performance, Greece defeated the Baton Rouge Jumbo Shrimp 12–3 to win their first-round best-of-three series 2–1 and punch their ticket to the PJPL Summer 2025 semifinals.</p>

      <p>Fueled by a career performance from Caje Riess, the Chicken Frogs now advance to face the top-seeded Madagascar Monkeys, who received a first-round bye.</p>

      <h2>Series Summary:</h2>
      <p>Game 1: Greece 12–0 Baton Rouge<br>
         Game 2: Baton Rouge 12–10 Greece<br>
         Game 3: Greece 12–3 Baton Rouge</p>

      <p>What began as a lopsided shutout in Game 1 turned into a tense three-game battle — but Greece left no doubts in the deciding match.</p>

      <blockquote>“This was the best I’ve ever seen him play,” one PJPL analyst said of Riess. “He didn’t just win — he dictated. The serves were aggressive. The placement was clinical. It was a complete performance.”</blockquote>

      <h2>Game-by-Game Breakdown</h2>

      <p>Game 1 set the tone. Riess came out firing, landing ace after ace and breaking down John Rusinko's rhythm early. It was the first shutout of the PJPL playoffs this season and a statement from a player often overlooked in league discussions.</p>

      <p>“I was just in rhythm,” Riess said postgame. “Everything felt right. Serve, return, pace — it all clicked.”</p>

      <p>But the momentum swung wildly in Game 2. The Jumbo Shrimp jumped out to a dominant 8–2 lead, with Rusinko showing rare poise and shot selection under pressure. But just as the game looked like a runaway, Greece clawed back with an aggressive 8–0 run of their own, stunning the crowd to take a 10–8 lead.</p>

      <p>However, the comeback wasn’t enough. A pair of unforced errors from Riess and a refocused finish from Rusinko gave Baton Rouge the final four points — and a hard-earned 12–10 win. It was Rusinko’s first-ever playoff victory and a brief reminder of his grit under pressure.</p>

      <p>Still, any optimism evaporated early in Game 3, when Riess opened with a 5–0 run and never looked back. Rusinko, visibly rattled, struggled with unforced errors and mistimed volleys as the score widened. The final margin — 12–3 — was a brutal end to what had briefly looked like a comeback.</p>

      <h2>Looking Ahead: Monkeys Await</h2>

      <p>Greece will now face the #1 seeded Madagascar Monkeys, led by league MVP frontrunner Austin Allen. The matchup pits Riess, fresh off his best form, against the league’s most dominant player — a massive challenge that will test just how far Greece’s postseason spark can carry them.</p>

      <p>“We’re not scared,” Riess said when asked about the upcoming matchup. “They’re the number one seed, sure. But at this point in the season, we all believe we can win.”</p>

      <p>With momentum building and confidence rising, the Chicken Frogs — soon to become the Czechia Tree Frogs — have a chance to extend their final run under the Greece banner into something truly historic.</p>
